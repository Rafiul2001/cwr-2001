                <p class="about-text">Hi guys!<br>
                    Welcome to my website. I am a student. I love to do code also fast learner. I have learned HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. This webpage is made with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.<br><br>
                    When I was in class five, I saw computer for the first time. But back then I didn't know how to use it. My father and uncle used computer for their official work. When they were working on the computer, I would sit nearby and watch. One day my uncle taught me how to operate a computer. I was very happy to use the computer for the first time.<br> <br>
                    When I was in class six, for the first time, I listened to music and watched movies on YouTube using the internet on computer. At first I used the internet using a modem, then I got broadband. At that time I loved to play games on computer. <br><br>
                    School life passed and I entered the college life. Here in my ICT book I saw HTML and C program for the first time and I was very excited. I execute all the program which is relatable to HTML and C programming language. I was loving to do code and trying to make new thing using what I learned.<br><br>
                    College life also passed and now I am an University student, studying Computer Science & Engineering. So many time passed and now I want to be a web developer. Journey has begun.
